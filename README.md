# Machine Learning scripts Master Thesis Project
Repository created in order to share with the community the python notebooks that contain the Machine Learning models developed during my master thesis at TU Delft related to Numerical Combustion. 
For more information regarding the theoretical background of the lookup tables used in Numerical simulations of Turbulent combustion, you can read my master thesis in the following link : https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:0e4db0e6-1852-4346-ad25-11f3eed9d0bd?collection=education
